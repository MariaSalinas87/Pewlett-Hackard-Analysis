We organized the data and found out there were 9 departments in the company.  The departments were as picture above shows: Marketing, Finance, Human Resources, Production, Development, Quality Management, Sales, Research, and Customer Service. Organizing data is very important because it helps us organize our findings. 

4.	We discovered 25 department managers would be retiring. This information is important because those positions require much training. It is important to start planning ahead for business to go as uninterrupted as possible. There would be 2 managers retiring from Department 001, 2 managers from Department 002, 3 managers from Department 003, 4 managers from department 004, 2 managers from Department 005, 4 managers from Department 006, 2 managers from Department 007, 2 Managers from Department 008, and 4 managers from Department 009.



Summary
According to our data, there will be a total of 72,458 employees that will be retiring in the coming years. There are a total of 1550 employees who are ready to be part of the mentorship program. Therefore; due to the demand of the job, there are not enough employees. The company will need to hire more employees and train them to the company’s standards.  We could create a query that tracks the departments each mentorship eligible employee has worked in to see qualification.  We can also create a query that specifies how many retirees from each department will be needed, based on the result we can see how many employees will be needed to be trained.
